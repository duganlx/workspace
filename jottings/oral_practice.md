### part 1

Inner peace. Inner peace.

Itchy `ˈɪtʃi` nose. 

Finally, inner peace.

Now what?

Kai, old friend.

Master Oogway.

Our battle ended 500 years ago!

Well, now I'm ready for a rematch.

Took you long enough!

You've grown stronger.

500 years in the Spirit `ˈspɪrɪt` Realm `relm`, you pick up a thing or two.

I have taken the chi of every master here.

No! Yes.

And soon I will have your Power, too.

When will you realize?

The more you take, the less you have.

With your chi, I will finally be able to return to the mortal `ˈmɔrt(ə)l` world.

And this time, you won't be there to stop me.

It was never my destiny `ˈdestəni` to stop you.

I have set another on that path.

Then I will find him... and take his chi, too.

......

You guys aren't doing the dramatic Pose, are you?

Do we have to strike `straɪk` a Pose every time we land?

You guys, never underestimate `ˌʌndərˈestɪmət` the Power of a dramatic entrance `ɪnˈtræns`.

I've heard about some masters who can win a fight just by throwing open a door.

Dramatic entrance?

Master Shifu.

The Dragon Warrior is correct.

Really? I was just making... Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

Before the battle of the fist `fɪst` comes the battle of the mind.

Hence, the dramatic entrance.

Nice dramatic entrance. What's the occasion `əˈkeɪʒ(ə)n` ? 

Today will be my final class. 

Your final...? Wait.

I didn't even know you were sick!

Although you have been looking a little...

I'm not sick.

...healthy. A little healthy. A lot, actually.

My final class, because from now on... 

your training will be in the hands of the Dragon Warrior.

What?

Me, teach? I mean, why not Tigress?

She's always telling everyone what to do.

Be quiet, Po.

You see what I mean?

Tigress is not the Dragon Warrior. You are.

Come on, they're the Five. What could I teach them?

There is always something more to learn, even for a master.

For instance, let me show you another move, the Dramatic Exit.

What's that? 

Wow! Are you kidding me?

Where'd he go?

Master. Master

He's gone, guys. It's cool.

We await your instruction `ɪnˈstrʌkʃ(ə)n`, Master.

All you have to lose is our respect.

I mean, seriously, how bad can it be?

Very bad! Very, very bad!

......

Good job, Po.

Did you at least learn a little something?

Yes. That you can't teach.

And Tigress is flammable `ˈflæməb(ə)l`, it turns out.

Yeah, that was a complete `kəmˈplit` disaster `dɪˈzæstər`.

Uh, I'm glad we're not Po right now.

What a loser!

What's Shifu thinking?

What was Oogway thinking?

I think he heard us.

I didn't hear anything.

Uh, he said you're a loser.

I'm sorry, Oogway.

Would you stop doing that?

How was your first day teaching?

Humiliating `hjuˈmɪliˌeɪtɪŋ`. I heard.

Who told you? Did Tigeress tell you?

I heard from Monkey, and Crane `kreɪn`, and Mantis `ˈmæntis`.
and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop, 
and those ducks you just passed, 
and Tigeress told me.

Yeah, well, did she also tell you that it'll never happen again? Because I'm done.

Teaching or being humilated?

Both! I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class.

Oh, I knew you couldn't.

What? You set me up to fail? Why?

If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now.

I don't wanna be more! I like who I am.

You don't even know who you are.

What do you... Of course I do. I'm the Dragon Warrior.

And what exactly does that mean, the Dragon Warrior?
